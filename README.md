# Source-Based Network Reachability Restriction: Two-Router Topology

This Packet Tracer project demonstrates a network configuration using **source-based routing** to restrict or permit reachability between subnets based on the source IP address.

## 🔧 Project Overview

- 📘 **Topology**: Two Cisco routers connected in a WAN scenario with multiple LAN segments.
- 🔐 **Objective**: Control packet forwarding based on the source address using advanced routing techniques.
- 🔄 **Routing Method**: Source-based policy routing (PBR) or ACL-based traffic filtering.
- 🧪 **Use Case**: Useful in security-sensitive networks where access depends not only on the destination but also on where the traffic originates.

## 📁 File Included

- `source_based_network_reachability_two_router.pkt`: The complete Packet Tracer simulation file.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer (tested on version 8.2.1 and above)
- Cisco IOS CLI for router configuration

## ✅ Features

- Demonstrates restricted access from certain source subnets
- Shows practical application of policy-based routing or ACLs
- Easily extendable for three-router or firewall-based scenarios
